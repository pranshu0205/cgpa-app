# CGPA Calculator (Streamlit)

A dynamic CGPA calculator for the BS in Data Science & Applications grading scheme.
- You select **grades** only; **credits are fixed** per subject.
- The app looks up grade points automatically and computes **CGPA**.
- According to the institute rule, courses with **I/P/F/DR** are **excluded** from GPA/CGPA. **U/W** are included with 0 points.

   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
